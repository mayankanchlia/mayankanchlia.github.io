I am currently working as a Senior Software engineer in [Samsung Research Institute Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) in Visual Intelligence Team. My team is responsible for all types of camera-related solutions for Samsung camera for smartphones. I have worked on a variety of camera-related technologies and currently working on computer vision to improve the AR experience.

I graduated in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus. During undergraduate days I had worked on several projects in VR, web development, Wireless Sensor network and machine learning. During my time at BITS, I have taken up courses in the domain of Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Systems and Algorithms. During the internship, I worked as an intern in the Tizen SDK team at Samsung Research, working on an algorithm to translate Source code from Microsoft UWP to Tizen. The work was based on Roslyn, XAML, C#.

Aside from computer science I am a hobbyist photographer and like to travel, exploring attractions with my lens.
